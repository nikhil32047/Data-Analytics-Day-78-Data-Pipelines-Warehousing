Advanced Data Engineering for Analysts

ðŸ”¹ Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Pipelines
===============================================
Summary:
A data pipeline automates the flow of data from source â†’ processing â†’ storage â†’ dashboard.
Components: Extraction, Transformation, Loading (ETL)
Tools: Airflow, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory
Benefits: Scalability, reliability, automation

Example:
Automating daily data collection from APIs â†’ cleaning in Python â†’ loading into Power BI dashboard.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 2: ETL vs ELT
=========================
Summary:
Both are data movement strategies, but in different orders:
ETL â†’ Extract â†’ Transform â†’ Load (used in traditional systems)
ELT â†’ Extract â†’ Load â†’ Transform (used in cloud systems like BigQuery, Snowflake)

Example:
ETL: Clean data before sending to SQL Server.
ELT: Load raw data to BigQuery, then use SQL to clean it.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3: Data Warehousing Concepts
===========================================
Summary:
A data warehouse is a central repository for analytics.
Layers: Staging â†’ Integration â†’ Presentation
Schema types: Star, Snowflake
Tools: Snowflake, Redshift, Google BigQuery

Example:
A retail company stores all sales, customer, and marketing data in Snowflake for unified analysis.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 4: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse
==========================================
Summary:
-----------
Feature	Data Lake	Data Warehouse
Data Type	Raw, unstructured	Processed, structured
Purpose	Storage & exploration	Analytics & reporting
Tool Example	AWS S3	Snowflake, Redshift

Example:
Data Lake: Store all customer click logs.
Data Warehouse: Use processed purchase data for reports.


ðŸ”¹ Lesson 5: Case Study â€“ End-to-End Retail Data Pipeline
=========================================================
Summary:
Steps:
--------
Extract daily sales from SQL database
Clean data in Python (Pandas)
Load into Snowflake warehouse
Build Power BI dashboard to track sales trends

Example:
The pipeline reduced report generation time from 3 hours â†’ 10 minutes ðŸš€
